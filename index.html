        <p>The student life is the best period of our life. It is the time during which boys and girls get their
            education in different educational institutions. The life is free from all sorts’ anxieties. This is the
            time when a student gathers knowledge, builds up his character and prepares himself for the future life. His
            future life depends on how he spends his student life. If he makes the best use of his time, he will be
            happy. If he neglects his duties, he will suffer in life. So it is rightly called the sowing season of human
            life. A student’s primary duty is to acquire knowledge. For that, he must study hard. He should read
            newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. He should be careful about his health. He should maintain the laws
            of keeping good health. He should be always neat and clean. He must avoid bad companions. He should be
            obedient to his parent, teachers, and superiors. He must be upright and truthful. He should learn good
            manners. He should be gentle and well-behaved. During leisure, he should take part in spreading education
            among illiterate people. During holidays and leisure hours, they should try to help their parents in their
            household works. They should so help their motherland in any national calamity. A student of today is the
            citizen of tomorrow. So he should utilize his student life properly.</p>
